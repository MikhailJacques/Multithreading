// Example for thread

// Thread - Class to represent individual threads of execution.

// A thread of execution is a sequence of instructions that can be executed concurrently 
// with other such sequences in multithreading environments, while sharing a same address space.

// An initialized thread object represents an active thread of execution. 
// Such a thread object is joinable, and has a unique thread id.

// A default-constructed (non-initialized) thread object is not joinable
// and its thread id is common for all non-joinable threads.

// A joinable thread becomes not joinable if moved from or if either join or detach are called on them.
